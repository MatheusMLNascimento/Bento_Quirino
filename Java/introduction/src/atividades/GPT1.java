         Then compute the average of all the elements in the array.

         3 - Declare an array of strings with 3 elements
         and initialize it with your favorite colors.
         Then loop through the array and print out each element.

         and initialize it with random values between 1 and 10.
         Then find the maximum value in the array.

         5 - Declare an array of integers with 10 elements
         and initialize it with random values between -5 and 5.
         Then count the number of positive, negative, and zero elements in the array.

         6 - Declare an array of strings with 5 elements
         and initialize it with random words.
         Then sort the array in alphabetical order.

         7 - Declare an array of integers with 15 elements
         and initialize it with random values between 1 and 100.
         Then find the second-largest value in the array.

         8 - Declare an array of doubles with 20 elements
         and initialize it with random values between -10 and 10.
         Then compute the sum of all the even elements in the array.

         9 - Declare an array of integers with 12 elements
         and initialize it with random values between 1 and 30.
         Then find the average value of the elements at even indexes (i.e. 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

         10 - Declare an array of integers with 8 elements
         and initialize it with random values between 1 and 100.
         Then implement a binary search algorithm to find a specific value in the array.*/
